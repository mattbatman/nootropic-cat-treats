# Nootropic Cat Treats

This version is built with Gatsby. Check different branches for different frameworks or JavaScript flavors (e.g. ReasonML).

Unlike with other versions, the Gatsby version iterates through quotes sequentally and uses URL parameters (e.g. /quotes/:id). Other versions select the next quote randomly. The switch to Gatsby was to attempt to allow quotes to be indexed by search engines, such as Brave Search.

## Getting Started

Google Sheets is used as a database prior to building the production version. A spreadsheet is maintained with the following columns in this order:
1. `id`
2. `quote`
3. `quotee`
4. `platform`
5. `link`
6. `length`

A JSON file of quotes can be generated by duplicating `sheets/config.example.js` as `sheets/config.js`, completing the needed variables, and running the npm script to fetch and transform the quotes from the Google Sheet. Gatsby uses the generated JSON file of quotes to generate a page for each quote.

So, if cloning this for your own use, you'd need to create your own Google Sheet of quotes with the appropriate columns and fields, download credentials from the Google Developer console, copy your sheet ID from the URL bar, and complete the `sheets/config.js` file.


Finally:
```
npm install
npm run fetch-quotes
npm run develop
```
