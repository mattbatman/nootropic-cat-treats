    quote: `You’ve probably heard the fable about, I think it’s Buridan’s donkey,
    who…it’s a fable about a donkey that is standing halfway in-between a pile
    of hay and a bucket of water. And he just keeps looking left, to the hay, or
    right, to the water, trying to decide. Hay, or water? Hay, or water? And he
    is unable to decide, so he eventually falls over and dies of both hunger and thirst.`,

    quote: `
    Dear God,
    Thank you so much for letting us exist. I can't believe we got even a few moments
    to experience what it's like to be thrust into time as monkey-descendants
    with an advanced biocomputer that allows us to experience a past, present, and
    future. And though, at this moment, we may find ourselves surrounded by deeply
    brainwashed weirdos whose entire conceptualization of reality has been constructed
    for them by religious institutions, corporations, or politicians, please help
    us remember that our family is actually me, wrapped around the infinite
    goodness of the universe, and just because we're currently acting like vicious
    hyenas doesn't mean that we don't suffer, just like anyone else. Help us
    see beyond our temporary mask of cuntiness, to the never ending transcendent glory
    that our puffy, wrinkled, alcoholic, racist, intolerant, hypocritical, news-obsessed
    skin-suits hang upon. And thank you for this incredible show called human
    incarnation. Please grant everyone at this table a lifetime of ever increasing,
    powerful orgasms. Orgasms that move all of us in the direction of heightened
    states of consciousness, so that we can truly allow ourselves to surrender
    to the strange attractor at the end of time, that is rapidly transforming
    history into something that will be completely unrecognizable to those that
    survive the economic and societal upheavals that await for us as we go plunging
    into the singularity. Thank you God, Hare Krishna.
