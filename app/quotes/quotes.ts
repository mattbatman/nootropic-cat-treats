      You’ve probably heard the fable about, I think it’s Buridan’s donkey,
      who…it’s a fable about a donkey that is standing halfway in-between a pile
      of hay and a bucket of water. And he just keeps looking left, to the hay, or
      right, to the water, trying to decide. Hay, or water? Hay, or water? And he
      is unable to decide, so he eventually falls over and dies of both hunger and thirst.

    <p>Dear God,</p>
    <p>
      Thank you so much for letting us exist. I can't believe we got even a few moments
      to experience what it's like to be thrust into time as monkey-descendants
      with an advanced biocomputer that allows us to experience a past, present, and
      future. And though, at this moment, we may find ourselves surrounded by deeply
      brainwashed weirdos whose entire conceptualization of reality has been constructed
      for them by religious institutions, corporations, or politicians, please help
      us remember that our family is actually me, wrapped around the infinite
      goodness of the universe, and just because we're currently acting like vicious
      hyenas doesn't mean that we don't suffer, just like anyone else. Help us
      see beyond our temporary mask of cuntiness, to the never ending transcendent glory
      that our puffy, wrinkled, alcoholic, racist, intolerant, hypocritical, news-obsessed
      skin-suits hang upon. And thank you for this incredible show called human
      incarnation. Please grant everyone at this table a lifetime of ever increasing,
      powerful orgasms. Orgasms that move all of us in the direction of heightened
      states of consciousness, so that we can truly allow ourselves to surrender
      to the strange attractor at the end of time, that is rapidly transforming
      history into something that will be completely unrecognizable to those that
      survive the economic and societal upheavals that await for us as we go plunging
      into the singularity.

    <p>Thank you God, Hare Krishna</p>

      Before I had children, I used to think of people as being sort of static.
      Obviously I was younger, and when you’re...especially when you’re really
      young, when you're like 20 or something like that, you don’t really take
      into consideration that the people around you used to be your age. You
      kind of know it in an abstract sort of a sense, but once you actually have
      a baby, and then like, 5 years later the baby’s talking to you and you’re
      having conversations you’re like, “Ah, you’re fucking learning shit now.”
      And then 10 years later the baby’s in high school and you’re like, “Oh
      Jesus Christ you’re almost a man.” And then…well, you realize, “Oh, we’re
      all babies who had babies.” And then you raise those babies and then they
      become adults and have babies of their own, but there are no grown ups.
      It’s bullshit. It doesn’t exist. Like when you’re a kid and you’re sad and
      you go, “Oh, one day I’m going to be a grown up and this is all going to
      make sense.” But that day never comes. You get older, but you’re a baby
      still. You’re just an old baby. You’re an old baby with a car and fucking
      credit card debt. And then you have a baby and then that baby grows up.

      eventually go, “Hey, guys, there’s a cliff coming up. Let’s just have a

      fucking shit out of him. And so I posted this thing about it today on
      instagram, and it was funny to watch everybody. I mean everybody’s into
      these fucking eigth place trophies, I want to kill people. Like, all this
