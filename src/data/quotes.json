And beyond a small group of people for an extremely brief period of time, little of what you say or do will ever matter. This is the Uncomfortable Truth of Life. And everything you think or do is but an elaborate avoidance of it. We are inconsequential cosmic dust, bumping and milling about on a tiny blue speck. We imagine our own importance. We invent our purpose &mdash; we are nothing.\n</p>\n<p>\nEnjoy your fucking coffee.\n</p>","quotee":"Mark Manson","platform":"Everything Is Fucked","link":"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07DTJ8YNJ/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_hsch_vapi_tkin_p1_i1"},{"id":"128","quote":"<p>\nWe arrived there at night; the whole of the population had assembled from the suburbs, we were surrounded by a crowd of children carrying torches, reiterating the acclamations of the citizens; all were eager to approach the person of him whom they called their father, and pressed so closely around us that they hindered us from proceeding.

Like, that's a big part of being alive right now, is like, we all think we're so fucking, we think we know everything because you can Google it. And you just think even if you don't know, you think the answer is out there somewhere. And then you live in this crazy world where you think everything's been figured out. We're at the cutting edge.\n</p>\n<p>\nLike, even though throughout history doctors have, in a lot of ways been consistently wrong. You know what I mean? Like the whole bleeding and leeching and before that whatever the weird medieval ways people would treat disease. You know? Like take a rag of horse piss and wrap it around their head and put them above a fire for 3 days. It will cure their pox! And everyone believes in them, like, \"Oh yeah, that will work!\"\n</p>\n<p>\nBut now we're like, \"No, no, no. Now we figured out medical technology for sure. Like, for we 100% know everything about the way the human body works.\" Which is why when you go into a doctor and depending on who the doctor is you mention some other possible therapy, they'll laugh you out of the room. They're like, \"Get the fuck out of here. That's quackery.\" And sometimes they're right, but sometimes they're probably wrong.\n</p>\n<p>\nBut my point is, it's just funny because you have to live in a world where you are surrounded by people who think, in one way, are really leaning into the idea that we've all kind of worked out the thing. We've figured out humanity. We've figured out the planet. We know what the climate is. We know what medical science is and how the body works. We understand germs, viruses, diseases, and history. We fucking know how the pyramids were built. And please stop saying aliens did it. It was people taking it from quarries. We've figured it out. You don't need to look into that anymore. Because we figured it out. When really we haven't figured out much of anything. Probably what's really going on is so astounding that if you actually saw what it was, you might die. You might just blip out of reality or cease to exist it's so wild.\n</p>","quotee":"Duncan Trussell","platform":"#1891 Duncan Trussell - The Joe Rogan Experience","link":"https://open.spotify.com/episode/38S004IeCWqwEscGoiPtgO?si=8f42d9805e884e73"},{"id":"130","quote":"<p>\nIf you could go back and look at tweets from 700 BC, and like, realize how insignificant you are in that vast scope of time.
