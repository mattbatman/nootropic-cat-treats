Dr. Fauci encouraged his own canonization and the disturbing inquisition against his blaphemous critics. In a June 9, 2021 _je suis l'etat_ interview, he pronounced that Americans who questioned his statements were, per se, anti-science. "Attacks on me," he explained, "quite frankly, are attacks on science." The sentiment he expressed reminds us that blind faith in authority is a function of religion, not science. Science, like democracy, flourishes on skepticism toward official orthodoxies. Dr. Fauci's schoolboy scorn for citation and his acknowledgement to the _New York Times_ that he had twice lied to Americans to promote his agendas — on masks and herd immunity — raised the prospect that some of his other "scientific" assertions were, likewise, _noble lies_ to a credulous public he believes is unworthy of self-determination.
