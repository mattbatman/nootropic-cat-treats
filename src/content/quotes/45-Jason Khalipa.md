Yesterday, I was on the road, and this woman is just tailing me so hard — coming around, getting all crazy — and I just look over at her, and I’m just like, “Easy. Like, eeeaaasssyyy. Like, live is good. You have a beautiful car. You look healthy and young and pretty. Whatever. Like, chill the hell out.” You know? And I think people — they getso caught up in these little problems, and they let it manifest into something so great that they stop — they never stop to reflect that, “Hey, look — life is OK.”
