Didn't you tell me one time, at dinner, once, maybe, about...you used to, you used to make up stories about the stars?

Yeah, that was in Alaska. Under the night skies.

Yeah, you used to lay there, look up. Yeah. At the stars.

You remember, I never watched a TV until I was 17 so there wasn't much to fucking do out there besides walk around, explore.

And...and look up at the stars and make up stories. Like what?

I tell you Marty, I've been up in that room, looking out those windows every night here, just thinking — it's just one story. The oldest.

What's that?

Light versus dark.

Well, I know we ain't in Alaska but, it appears to me that the dark has a lot more territory.

Yeah, you're right about that. Hey listen, could you point me in the direction of that car? Man, I spent enough of my fucking life in hospitals.

Jesus. Oh. You know what? I'd protest, but it occurs to me that you're un-killable. You wanna go back and get clothes or anything?

No. Anything I left back there, I don't need...you know, you're looking at it wrong — that sky thing.

How's that?

Well, once there was only dark. If you ask me, the lights winning.
