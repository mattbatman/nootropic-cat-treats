...This goes back to a Biblical question, though -- is that: do people want to be free? And that is a very difficult question to answer. In the books of Exodus and Numbers, the answer is, "No." Is that, if you fail to teach a generation the value of liberty, they actually instinctively don't want to be free. When God delivered his chosen people out of Egypt and he performed the most amazing miracles imaginable -- you know -- the Nile River goes red, and frogs from the sky, and first born dead, and the Red Sea parts, and they go into the Sinai Desert -- after a couple chapters, they're like, "Hey, we want to go back to Egypt. We want to go back to slavery. Why? Because the food was better. Literally. We had melons, leeks, cucumbers, and meat." And they say, "Hey Moses, can we go back to Egypt?" Now mind you, this is when God blew quail off course and mana from heaven and they needed and wanted for nothing, but they preferred to be slaves that were taken care of than free citizens in the desert where they had to be responsible.

And that is a very important lesson for all of us: that liberty is a value that we must pass on, that we must cherish, and part of the population will never wake up, because they would rather be in Egypt.
