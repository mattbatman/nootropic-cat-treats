\[Jeff Deist\] said, which I really liked, he was like, this really stuck with me, "You know, when you're living through a revolution, you don't necessarily know, 'Oh, the revolution started today. And now I'm in the revolution. And this is 5 days into the revolution.'" It's not until years later that you look back at it and go, 'Oh, I guess that was a revolution.'"

Now, I don't know if that's exactly how you would describe the covid regime, but in many ways I think it's changed life more than a traditional revolution would. You know like, if a regime was overthrown by a coup and someone else took power, it certainly wouldn't necessarily end up every single social norm down to like, showing your face in public or shaking hands or what you're allowed to do or — or what the rise of covid has done has been really like, unbelievably profound. It's changed everything about our society. And the idea that while this is all happening, you're not allowed to like, question it. To think about, "I'm not sure this is the right decision. I think maybe this is wrong. I think maybe we should do this." That all throughout it, these voices have been silenced off of social media — and they've been really demonized in a very aggressive way — and so many of them have turned out to be right. Not all of them were, but the official narrative coming from the regime has been wrong so much. I mean they talk about spreading covid disinformation, the entire establishment talking points have been disinformation from the beginning. Down to the biggest one, lockdowns, they just had this huge John Hopkins study that basically their conclusion was that lockdowns did next to nothing to mitigate covid deaths and caused far more deaths.
