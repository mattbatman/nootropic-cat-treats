I coach &mdash; every year I've coached, when things don't go well, I point the finger at me. A lot of coaches won't do that, but at the end of the day, when things go well, I point the fingers at the players.

That's just kind of been my nature of how I've coached over the years. You know, I know how was it when I played, and I played for coaches that had success with me and I played for coaches that haven't had success.

And you know, sometimes coaches don't want to take the blame and want to put all on the players. I'm not that type of coach. Even though I don't miss jump shots, wide open shots, don't miss free throws, I'm still a big part of it and, you know, I take a lot of responsibility.
