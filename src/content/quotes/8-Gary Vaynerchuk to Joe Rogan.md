I didn’t let my brother AJ score on me in basketball — he’s 11 years younger than me — until he was like, 15. Score. Like, score.

You wouldn’t let him?

No! Now I have a 4 year old guy — Zander, my little guy — he’s got a weird condition. When he picks up the basketball, he starts kind of weirdly crying, because he knows dad’s going to come out of somewhere and block the fucking shit out of him. And so I posted this thing about it today on instagram, and it was funny to watch everybody. I mean everybody’s into these fucking eigth place trophies — I want to kill people. Like, all this fake infrastructure of fake fucking self-esteem and then these kids go into the market, and they get punched in the mouth and they don’t know what to do.
