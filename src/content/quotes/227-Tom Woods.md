One headline put it this way: "Biden Congratulates Cost Guard Hero He's Trying to Fire."

Zach Loesch is "unvaccinated," so he's going to leave the Coast Guard.

This is the same man Joe Biden, not even a week ago, described as a hero for his work in Florida.

In fact, he called Loesch on the telephone to "personally thank" him for his "heroic work," and then praised him again in a public speech.

And Loesch did indeed deserve praise: he kicked through a wall to rescue a 94-year-old disabled woman and her husband, getting them and her wheelchair hoisted onto a helicopter even with heavy winds.

Loesch applied for a religious exemption and was denied, and his appeal of the denial was also denied, so now he has no choice but to leave.

When Karine Jean-Pierre, White House press secretary, was asked about Loesch and whether the President would ever consider lifting any of these mandates or issuing more exemptions, her is the answer we received:

> As you can imagine, the President has the deepest respect for the U.S. Coast Guard. That is something that you would hear from him directly. And the President and the country are grateful for all the U.S. Coast Guard heroes that have led the effort to save lives in Florida. We have seen that with our very own eyes these past couple of days. I would refer you specifically to the U.S. Coast Guard on this issue, on this individual question. It's not something that I would comment from here. But there of course have been multiple vaccination requirements, as you know, in place for quote some time, but again I'm not going to comment from here on an individual case.

What on God's green earth is the point of that non-answer?

...

As Loesch himself put it, "If I had asked any of the people I saved yesterday if they wanted to come with me even though I am unvaccinated, every single one of them would have said 'yes.'"
