I have had a lot of relationships with liberals -- I've been in journalism my whole life, most of the people I've dealt with were liberal -- and I've never ended a relationship over politics. I never would, because I don't think it's the most important thing.

I don't go on social media too often, but occasionally I'll hear so-and-so has been attacking me, and I'm surprised. *Really?* That person was my editor and my friend, we used to have dinner all the time. So I've definitely had liberals I really like stop talking to me, and it's always a little bit shocking.

I have a religion, I don't need a new one. But for a lot of people on the left, it is their religion and this is a holy war, and they can't be friends with unbelievers.
