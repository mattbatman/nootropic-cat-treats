But really my personal best moments of my life are feeling that zen understanding of timelessness and those moments in eternity that are endless. Those are the best moments of my life. And really realizing that we're just part of infinity. And you see the steps, and you know that it's not going to go exactly how you want it to but there's going to be a goal at the end you reach that's better for everybody. And you know it's going to be painful. And you know you're going to make mistakes. You know you're even going to hurt people on the way, but you're doing it from a place of goodness and so you forgive yourself for that. It's that process of being destroyed that by the end you're complete.
