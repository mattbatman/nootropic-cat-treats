Dr. Fauci's aficionados, including President Biden and the cable and network news anchors, counseled Americans to "trust the experts." Such advice is both anti-democratic and anti-science. Science is dynamic. "Experts" frequently differ on scientific questions and their opinions can vary in accordance with and demands of politics, power, and financial self-interest. Nearly every lawsuit I have ever litigated pitted highly credentialed experts from opposite sides against each other, with all of them swearing under oath to diametrically antithetical positions based on the same set of facts. Telling people to "trust the experts" is either naive or manipulative â€” or both.
