Bears are cannibals. Almost all bears are cannibals. My friend saw these two bears fighting. There was a male bear who came in because there was a female and her cubs, and the female tried to chase off the male bear, but the male bear got ahold of one of her cubs and killed it. And she chased off the male bear, after the male bear killed her cubs, and then she ater her cub.

Well, it was...I mean...the dead one, right?

Yes. She ate her dead cub.

Jesus.

Right after she was trying to protect it, the moment it became meat, she ate her cub.
