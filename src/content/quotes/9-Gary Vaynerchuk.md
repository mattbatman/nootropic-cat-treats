You know the problem with, “woe is me?” Nobody’s fucking listening. My friends, let me tell you who’s listening to you complain. Either the two or three people that kind of have to because they’re your parents, or your other fucking losing friends. Nobody gives a fuck. That’s the problem. What nobody understands about complaining is that it has zero ROI.
