Everything that happens is either endurable or not.

If it’s endurable, then endure it. Stop complaining.

If it’s unendurable...then stop complaining. Your destruction will mean it’s end as well.

Just remember: you can endure anything your mind can make endurable, by treating it as in your interest to do so.

In your interest, or in your nature.
