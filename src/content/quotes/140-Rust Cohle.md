In this universe, we process time, linearly, forward. But outside of our space time, from what would be a fourth dimensional perspective, time wouldn't exist. And from that vantage, could we attain it?

We see our space time would look flattened, like a single sculpture, of matter, superposition, every place it ever occupied. Our sentience just cycling through our lives like carts on a track.

See everything outside our dimension, that's eternity. Eternity looking down on us. Now to us, it's a sphere. But to them, it's a circle.
