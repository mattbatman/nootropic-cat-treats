That's Dusty May. Florida Atlantic. I'm telling you man, he's done an unbelievable job. If I'm an AD \[Athletic Director\], I'm hiring him, man. I mean I'm telling you right now, I'm hiring him. I mean he's a great looking dude, he speaks, he's he's just charismatic. I don't know what to tell you, but I think he's absolutely terrific, and I'm proud...

I think I was there one year with him at Indiana. That was when I had to punch Coach Knight. I did. I had to punch him. Knight hit me in practice. Boom! Yelling and screaming and finally I had enough and he came at me in a little room off of Assembly Hall, off of the locker room. Nobody ever knew this. I was scared to death that I was going to get fired. Knight was evil in terms of coming back at his enemies, so I never told anybody this until about a year ago. I didn't even tell my wife. I didn't even tell my family. But he came at me in this room and I drilled him in the chest and knocked him back. Uh...and that ended him being a bully. But, I don't even know why I got into that story, but I think that was the year Dusty was there. Um...I think â€” I could be wrong. But sometimes a dude needs to be punched.
