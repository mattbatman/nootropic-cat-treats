There’s a phrase I really hate: “stay safe.”

And I hate all the variations like “be safe,” “be careful,” or “don’t do anything I wouldn’t do.”

The default for all humans, and really all animals, is to be safe. We don’t need to tell someone to avoid pain, suffering, or dangerous situations. We are built to avoid these things. Self-preservation is ingrained in us. Of course, different people have varying levels of this instinct. Some are more prone to taking risks, while others might prioritize safety above all. But at a basic level, we lean toward safety and away from risk-taking. Yet, you don’t achieve much in life if you don’t take risks.

And no, I’m not talking about jumping from airplanes or doing cliff dives. I mean exposing yourself to discomfort, whether imagined or real. It might mean starting a business or getting the courage to talk to that attractive person across the room. Every single day, we get opportunities to step out of our comfort zone. Outside of that zone is where the excitement, innovation, and significant changes happen. And sure, bad things can happen too, but on balance, taking more risks can lead to a happier, more productive, and successful life.

Consider this: we live in the safest period in human history. There are numerous safety nets available. Few people are going hungry, and fewer are without a place to live. With support systems like unemployment and welfare available, taking risks has become a bit easier. And knowing my readers, you are a capable group. If you've joined this list, you're probably ready to take some risks. I say this because I’ve met many of you and have talked to you.

So, back to my hated phrase: "be safe." We don’t need to tell people to stay safe; it’s already their inclination. Instead, we should be telling people to take risks, to be daring, to show courage.

And, as I said earlier, taking a risk doesn’t always mean going all-in with your savings or your body. It could mean just speaking to that person who catches your eye, who might become your life partner, the parent to your children, and the grandparent to your grandchildren. Imagine taking that risk and opening yourself up to potential rejection for the chance of lifelong love and the continuation of your genetic line.

I’d say that’s a risk worth taking.
