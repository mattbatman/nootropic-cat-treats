LIke Schwab, Nadella wants to dazzle you with the technological changes, because if you're a little intimidated, it makes you easier to control. You won't raise your hand to ask a question because you don't want to sound stupid. Maybe that's my superpower. I don't mind sounding stupid. (And don't you always remember your teachers saying, "There's no such thing as a stupid question"?)

But when they can't answer my stupid questions, well, who's the stupid one?
