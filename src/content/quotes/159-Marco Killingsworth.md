When I was playing, I was 270, then I went overseas and...I tell people I can tell the difference between the food we eat here in America and the food we eat over there, like there's a lot processed and stuff like that. I ate the same thing — chicken wings, stuff like that, and I got down — when I played at Indiana I was 270 — I got down to 230, and I played for like 10 years at 230. And I eat the same bullshit. I come back here, and I had to switch my diet when I got over there, had to switch my diet up. And I tell people, man I eat very, very clean. You know, I don't eat too much meat. I eat fish every frickin' at least 6 days a week, and hell I done put on 60 pounds. I must of.

I know it's the difference with people here. I say, just go to Europe. You want to lose some weight? Go to Europe, and just eat the same way. Potatoe chips, to McDonald's, to all that shit.
