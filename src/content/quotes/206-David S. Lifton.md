Jenkins' account suggests that President Kennedy's body, even though altered, was not altered sufficiently to create the unambiguous appearance of a shot from the rear.

Central to his experience is his belief that the President was shot in the head from the front, and that that fact was covered up from the start. Throughout our conversation, it seemed that Jenkins was still frightened. He told me that on a number of occasions he had "considered trying to put this in my own words, because I wanted &mdash; I wanted to have it down...for history." He didn't necessarily want to publish it. "I wanted to put it down on paper in my own words, not so much for anybody else to know...I wanted to say what my feelings, what my conclusions were, before they were published from some other source..." But he never carried through such a plan, and now his memories of that night were getting fainter with each year. He told me he had considered consulting a hypnotist to strengthen his recollections.

I thought: how extraordinary to have seen the actual event occur, to have formed conclusions, and then watch history unfold another way. "That's a very interesting story," I said.

"It's a realistic thing to me," he said. "The fact is that my feelings of credibility, what I've been told, because of this..." His voice trailed off. He began again: "Every time there seems to be something of importance that affects the nation, and I'm told one way by the government, I'm skeptical about it. Because this was probably the most significant thing that had happened in this country in God knows how long, and my feelings are that the people themselves were just &mdash; well, to be quite frank &mdash; lied to about it, and for what reason I have no idea. I don't want to speculate on that &mdash; those type of things. If it's happened in something this important, this dramatic &mdash; I had almost wished that I had not been there..." HIs voice trailed off.
