Once you say one true thing and stick with it, all kinds of other true things occur to you. The truth is contagious -- lying is, but the truth is, as well. And the second you decide to tell the truth about something you are filled wit this, I don't wanna get supernatural on you, but you are filled with this power from somewhere else. Try it. Tell the truth about something, you feel it every day, the more you tell the truth, the stronger you become. That's completely real. It's measurable in the way that you feel. And, of course, the opposite is also true. The more you lie, the waker and more terrified you become.
