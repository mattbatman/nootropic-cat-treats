I recalled one person in particular who I'd met through writing years ago, who I'd initially thought was a writer but who had over time proven herself to be merely a _writer type_; she had written one inconsequential book of aphorisms, then became — like so many wealthy, arts-adjacent aphorists — an "activist."

Undifferentiated and only cosmetically varied, the literary world had become one swarming mass, like a rat king. Their cosmetic differences hid a frightened, stifled sameness, which sought only more of itself, and which cast out any true difference, often in the name of difference, while pretending, even to itself, that it didn't know what it was doing. Any time a group wasn't sufficiently differentiated, I knew, it aggressively descended into delusion; in which case only those who firmly stood outside could see the truth. The crowd is untruth...I thought, remembering the title of a Kierkegaard essay.
