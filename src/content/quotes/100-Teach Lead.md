If you want to party all day long, you can, and if you want to work all day long, you can as well. This is when you are actually in control, and you need to start putting your life in order. Add some structure to it. Think about what you really want to do with it â€” who are you going to be, and make that happen. Because no one is going to have the authority to be able to tell you what you should be doing.

You're not even going to want to listen to other people. Especially your family. Especially your dad. But what you will listen to are generally random influencers that you find online. People like me, which is why I got to be here making this video for you, because your dad actually had to phone me up and tell me to make a video for you, because he knows that you follow me on YouTube, so now I've got to do this show for you.
