In eternity where there is no time, nothing can grow, nothing can become, nothing changes. So death created time to grow the things that it would kill. And you are reborn, but into the same life that you've always been born into.

And how many times have we had this conversation detectives? Well who knows? I mean you can't remember your lives. You can't change your lives. And that is the terrible and secret fate of all life. You're trapped. Another nightmare you keep waking up into.
