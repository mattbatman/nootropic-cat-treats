A Republican bill declaring the Covid-19 emergency over is about to hit Joe Biden's desk, and the word is that he'll sign it.

The bill consists of a single sentence, declaring that the national emergency declared in the name of Covid-19 "is hereby terminated."

Over three years after the "fifteen days" thing.

We can hope that this means international travelers to the United States will soon no longer be required to subject themselves to the ridiculous vaccine requirement that the vast majority of countries have long since abandoned.

Given everything that even official sources now concede about the shots, there is no rationale for keeping that restriction in place.

As I look back over the past few years, I'm left flabbergasted at the wreckage.

I won't catalogue it all, because you know it well enough. But just for starters, people had their life's work destroyed, their savings decimated, their health compromised, their businesses ruined -- and that's not to mention the far more devastating consequences for the developing world.

Just the other day I had a mother write to me: her daughter can't proceed with her chosen profession, because the only school for it she can afford is still for some reason demanding the shots.

Beyond that, families and friends were torn apart, and dissidents demonized and isolated.

Then, too, you and I observed with our own eyes how readily our neighbors and countrymen instantly adopted the official line, displaying no curiosity at all, and not even bothering to see if any of the social destruction was actually doing any good.

And of course a central point I think we all grasped but rarely saw illustrated was what governments can get away with under cover of emergency.

Call something an emergency or a crisis, and all thought goes out the window on the part of the public -- a situation officials are all too happy to exploit.
