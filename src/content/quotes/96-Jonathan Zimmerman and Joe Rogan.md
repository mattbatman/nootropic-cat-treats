I think lots of evolutionary psychologists have tried to make the claim that we are joiners, and that there is an evolutionary logic to faith systems — you know — that they've helped us in all kinds of different ways, and we're always going to have some kind of version of them. And I think the scariest part of now, for me, is that our political affiliations have become quasi-religious.

I don't even think quasi.

Maybe flat out.

Pretty much flat out. And extremely tribal. And when you just analyze the behavior of people on both extremes, whether it's the far left or the far right, they exhibit remarkably similar traits. Like, pure hatred for the other side, inability to look at the virtues of this opposing ideology, and almost like treating it as if the very nature of reality is at stake.

Yes, and I have a purchase on it, and you are blind. Right? You know? God did not shine on you.

Which is the protestants versus the catholics, you know?
