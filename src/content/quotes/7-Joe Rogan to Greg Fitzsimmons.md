Have you ever heard of when people get poop transfusions?

No.

Yeah, they’ll take poop from a healthy person...

No!

Yes! Yes! It’s a real thing!

Ass to ass?

Well, they don’t make you go butt-to-butt with somebody. I think they go in and fish it out and they shoot it up in you. But they literally will shoot somebody else’s poop up your asshole, into your body. And some people even swallow poop tablets.
