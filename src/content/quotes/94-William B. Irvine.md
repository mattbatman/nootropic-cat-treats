Let me share with you the Daoist story of the farmer who's horse ran away.

When the neighbors heard what happened, they came to commiserate with the farmer. What bad luck they said. Maybe, he answered.

The next morning, the horse not only returned, but brough six wild horses with him. What good luck, his neighbors said. Maybe, the farmer answered.

The next day the farmer's son tried to ride one of the wild horses, but was thrown from it, and broke a leg. What bad luck, his neighbors said. Maybe, the farmer replied.

The day after that the Emperor's officers came to the farmer's village to conscript young men for the army. Because he had a broken leg, they rejected the farmer's son. What good luck, the villagers told him. Maybe, was all he replied.
