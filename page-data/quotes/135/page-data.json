It means that within the US government, there are forces wholly beyond democratic control. These forces are more powerful than the elected officials that supposedly oversee them. These forces can affect election outcomes. They can even hide their complicity in the murder of an American president. In other words, they can do pretty much anything they want.\n</p>\n<p>\nThey constitute a government within a government, mocking by their very existence the idea of democracy. As cynical as we have become after 30 years of watching goverment officials ignore the voters that employ them, we were shocked to learn this. It's not acceptable.\n</p>\n<p>\nAmericans have trusted their government less with every passing year since the killing of John F. Kennedy. Maybe this is why. And people have known this for a long time. The people who knew would include every director of the CIA since November of 1963. And that list would include Obama's CIA director, John Brennan, one of the most sinister and dishonest figures in American life. That list would also include, we are saddened to say, our friend Mike Pompeo, who ran the CIA in the last administration. Mike Pompeo knew this. We asked Pompeo to join us tonight, and though he rarely turns down a televised interview, he refused to come.\n</p>","quotee":"Tucker Carlson","platform":"Tucker Carlson Tonight, December 15, 2022","link":"https://www.foxnews.com/video/6317311778112"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2259100704"],"slicesMap":{}}
