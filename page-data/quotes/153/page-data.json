I mean, if I go to some parts of Los Angeles at night, yeah there are people who quote, \"are not violating the non-agression principle\" &mdash; they're just wandering around menacingly and aimlessly and in some other mental universe, and we get libertarians suggesting, \"Oh, well, I wrote a policy paper about how to fix this.\" I think it's unfixable. I think we have a gigantic number of people who are just gone. Their souls are empty. I don't know what to do about it, and I don't think that fixing housing policy &mdash; I think that's really naive. I think we have to admit some things just don't have political solutions.\n</p>","quotee":"Tom Woods","platform":"Ep. 2267 Have We Lost Younger People?
