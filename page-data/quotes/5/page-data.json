Obviously I was younger, and when you’re &mdash; especially when you’re really young, when you’re like 20 or something like that &mdash; you don’t really take into consideration that the people around you used to be your age. You kind of know it in an abstract sort of a sense, but once you actually have a baby, and then like, 5 years later the baby’s talking to you and you’re having conversations, you’re like, “Ah, you’re fucking learning shit now.” And then 10 years later the baby’s in high school, and you’re like, “Oh, Jesus Christ, you’re almost a man.” And then...well, you realize, “Oh, we’re all babies who had babies.” And then you raise those babies, and then they become adults and have babies of their own, but there are no grown-ups. It’s bullshit. It doesn’t exist. Like, when you’re a kid and you’re sad and you go, “Oh, one day I’m going to be a grown-up and this is all going to make sense.” But that day never comes. You get older, but you’re a baby still. You’re just an old baby. You’re an old baby with a car and fucking credit card debt. And then you have a baby and then that baby grows up.\n</p>","quotee":"Joe Rogan","platform":"Joe Rogan Experience, #891","link":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5AKVbx2M38&t=1h24m50s","length":"medium"}},
