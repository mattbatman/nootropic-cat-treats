Youkind of know it in an abstract sort of a sense, but once you actually havea baby, and then like, 5 years later the baby’s talking to you and you’rehaving conversations, you’re like, “Ah, you’re fucking learning shit now.”And then 10 years later the baby’s in high school, and you’re like, “OhJesus Christ, you’re almost a man.” And then...well, you realize, “Oh, we’reall babies who had babies.” And then you raise those babies, and then theybecome adults and have babies of their own, but there are no grown-ups.It’s bullshit. It doesn’t exist. Like, when you’re a kid and you’re sad andyou go, “Oh, one day I’m going to be a grown-up and this is all going tomake sense.” But that day never comes. You get older, but you’re a babystill. You’re just an old baby. You’re an old baby with a car and fuckingcredit card debt. And then you have a baby and then that baby grows up.</p>","quotee":"Joe Rogan","platform":"Joe Rogan Experience, #891","link":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5AKVbx2M38&t=1h24m50s","length":"medium","allQuotesLength":96}},
