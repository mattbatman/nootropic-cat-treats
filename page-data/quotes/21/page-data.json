So you go like,“I totally understand that you would think that &mdash; youknow &mdash; the earth is flat. I can see why you would havethought that. I mean you grew up here. Of course you thoughtthat.” If you empathize with them first, and then say, “Youknow, but, turns out it’s round,” they’re more likely tocome around. But if you say, “Hey, you know that’s fuckingwrong,” and if you show them proof, they double down even further.</p>","quotee":"Whitney Cummings","platform":"Joe Rogan Experience, #910","link":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_P55Bexc5s&t=2h26m20s","length":"long","allQuotesLength":96}},
