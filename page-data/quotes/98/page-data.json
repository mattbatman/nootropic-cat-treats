In a June 9, 2021 <i>je suis l'etat</i> interview, he pronounced that Americans who questioned his statements were, per se, anti-science. \"Attacks on me,\" he explained, \"quite frankly, are attacks on science.\" The sentiment he expressed reminds us that blind faith in authority is a function of religion, not science. Science, like democracy, flourishes on skepticism toward official orthodoxies. Dr. Fauci's schoolboy scorn for citation and his acknowledgement to the <i>New York Times</i> that he had twice lied to Americans to promote his agendas &mdash; on masks and herd immunity &mdash; raised the prospect that some of his other \"scientific\" assertions were, likewise, <i>noble lies</i> to a credulous public he believes is unworthy of self-determination.\n</p>","quotee":"Robert F.
