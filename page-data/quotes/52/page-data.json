When things are going bad, there’s going to be somegood that’s going to come from it. Didn’t get the high-speed gear we wanted?Didn’t get promoted? Good. More time to get better. Oh, mission got canceled?Good. We can focus on our other one. Didn’t get funded? Didn’t get the jobyou wanted? Got injured? Sprained my ankle? Got tapped out? Good. Got beat?Good. You learned. Unexpected problems? Good. We have the opportunity tofigure out a solution.”</p><p>That’s it. When things are going bad. Don’t get all bummed out. Don’t getstartled. Don’t get frustrated.</p><p>If you can say the word, “good.” Guess what? It means you’re still alive.It means you’re still breathing. And if you’re still breating, well thenhell &mdash; it means you’ve still got some fight left in you. So get up.Dust off. Reload. Recalibrate. Reengage.
