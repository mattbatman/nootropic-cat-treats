It’s a constant thing that’sgoing on all the time, and when you’re in the middle of it,in motion, that’s when you feel your best. But the discomfortof that motion makes people so uneasy that they feel like,“Well, I’m gonna go through this discomfort, and then I’mgoing to get to a place of stillness, where it’s all goingto make sense. Finally, I made it.”</p><p>I’m here to tell you &mdash; that fucking place doesn’t exist.It doesn’t exist. It’s not a real place. It’s a place thatpeople look to as an inspirational goal &mdash; a destination.And that’s going to be the thing that you work hard for.You’re going to push until you get to this place, and thenit’s all going to be worth it. That place is not real. If youhave a million dollars, you want a billion. If you have a bighouse, you want a bigger house.</p><p>You have to find out what actually makes you happy. And it’snot having all your ducks in a row on paper. It’s improvement.It’s improvement in the way you manage your mind. It’simprovement in the way you manage your emotions. It’sunderstanding how you’ve made mistakes and how to improveupon them, and also understanding what you’ve done right andbuilding upon that.</p><p>All of those things are what make people happy &mdash;including love, and friendship, and being good at that.Being a good friend. Being a good lover. Being a good neighbor.All those things &mdash; those aren’t distractions &mdash;those are part of the big overall of being a human being.</p>","quotee":"Joe Rogan","platform":"Joe Rogan on Happiness","link":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMlsPTH62Ks","length":"long"}},
