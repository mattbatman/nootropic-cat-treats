It’s a constant thing that’s going on all the time, and when you’re in the middle of it, in motion, that’s when you feel your best. But the discomfort of that motion makes people so uneasy that they feel like, “Well, I’m gonna go through this discomfort, and then I’m going to get to a place of stillness, where it’s all going to make sense. Finally, I made it.”\n</p>\n<p>\nI’m here to tell you &mdash; that fucking place doesn’t exist. It doesn’t exist. It’s not a real place. It’s a place that people look to as an inspirational goal &mdash; a destination. And that’s going to be the thing that you work hard for. You’re going to push until you get to this place, and then it’s all going to be worth it. That place is not real. If you have a million dollars, you want a billion. If you have a big house, you want a bigger house.\n</p>\n<p>\nYou have to find out what actually makes you happy. And it’s not having all your ducks in a row on paper. It’s improvement. It’s improvement in the way you manage your mind. It’s improvement in the way you manage your emotions. It’s understanding how you’ve made mistakes and how to improve upon them, and also understanding what you’ve done right and building upon that.\n</p>\n<p>\nAll of those things are what make people happy &mdash; including love, and friendship, and being good at that. Being a good friend. Being a good lover. Being a good neighbor. All those things &mdash; those aren’t distractions &mdash; those are part of the big overall of being a human being.\n</p>","quotee":"Joe Rogan","platform":"Joe Rogan on Happiness","link":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMlsPTH62Ks","length":"long"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2259100704"],"slicesMap":{}}
