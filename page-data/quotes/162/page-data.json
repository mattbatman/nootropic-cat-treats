Their cosmetic differences hid a frightened, stifled sameness, which sought only more of itself, and which cast out any true difference, often in the name of difference, while pretending, even to itself, that it didn't know what it was doing. Any time a group wasn't sufficiently differentiated, I knew, it aggressively descended into delusion; in which case only those who firmly stood outside could see the truth. The crowd is untruth...I thought, remembering the title of a Kierkegaard essay.\n</p>","quotee":"Jordan Castro","platform":"The Novelist, pg. 94","link":"https://softskull.com/dd-product/the-novelist/"}},
