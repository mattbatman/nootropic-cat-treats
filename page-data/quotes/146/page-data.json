Under the night skies.\n</p>\n<p>\nYeah, you used to lay there, look up. Yeah. At the stars.\n</p>\n<p>\nYou remember, I never watched a TV until I was 17 so there wasn't much to fucking do out there besides walk around, explore.\n</p>\n<p>\nAnd...and look up at the stars and make up stories. Like what?\n</p>\n<p>\nI tell you Marty, I've been up in that room, looking out those windows every night here, just thinking &mdash; it's just one story. The oldest. \n</p>\n<p>\nWhat's that?\n</p>\n<p>\nLight versus dark.\n</p>\n<p>\nWell, I know we ain't in Alaska but, it appears to me that the dark has a lot more territory.\n</p>\n<p>\nYeah, you're right about that.

You wanna go back and get clothes or anything?\n</p>\n<p>\nNo. Anything I left back there, I don't need...you know, you're looking at it wrong &mdash; that sky thing.\n</p>\n<p>\nHow's that?\n</p>\n<p>\nWell, once there was only dark. If you ask me, the lights winning.\n</p>","quotee":"Marty Hart and Rust Cohle","platform":"True Detective, Season 1","link":"https://play.hbomax.com/page/urn:hbo:page:GVU2xlQZIxY7DwvwIAVgK:type:series"}},
