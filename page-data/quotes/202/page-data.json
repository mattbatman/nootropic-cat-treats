And all I want to say to them is: the first motherfuckers to go are the people who sold out their own people. You need to study history. All you fucking politicians, need to study history. You brown shirts need to understand that once their plan is completed the FIRST person, the FIRST people to go are the snitches who sold out their own because nobody likes a sell-out, even the power bottom lizard people don't want people who sell out their own motherfuckers, dog. So keep cashing checks. Keep cashing checks. Keep voting against your own constituents best interest. And then when their plan is complete, get ready to go, bro. The brown shirts are the first ones to go, man. Fucking goodbye. Because nobody likes sell-out scumbags.\n</p>","quotee":"Sam Tripoli","platform":"#719: Not All Slaves Wear Chains With Larken Rose and Drew Treglia","link":"https://open.spotify.com/episode/1QWVcw7KhL6B4pCesiUFsi?si=5c4c40ede4bf4ab0"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2259100704"],"slicesMap":{}}
