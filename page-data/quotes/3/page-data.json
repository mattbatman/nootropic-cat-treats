I can’t believe we got even a few moments to experience what it’s like to be thrust into time as monkey-descendants with an advanced biocomputer that allows us to experience a past, present, and future.\n</p>\n<p>\nAnd though, at this moment, we may find ourselves surrounded by deeply brainwashed weirdos whose entire conceptualization of reality has been constructed for them by religious institutions, corporations, or politicians, please help us remember that our family is actually me, wrapped around the infinite goodness of the universe, and just because we’re currently acting like vicious hyenas doesn’t mean that we don’t suffer, just like anyone else.\n</p>\n<p>\nHelp us see beyond our temporary mask of cuntiness, to the never ending transcendent glory that our puffy, wrinkled, alcoholic, racist, intolerant, hypocritical, news-obsessed skin-suits hang upon. And thank you for this incredible show called human incarnation.\n</p>\n<p>\nPlease grant everyone at this table a lifetime of ever increasing, powerful orgasms &mdash; orgasms that move all of us in the direction of heightened states of consciousness, so that we can truly allow ourselves to surrender to the strange attractor at the end of time, that is rapidly transforming history into something that will be completely unrecognizable to those that survive the economic and societal upheavals that await for us as we go plunging into the singularity.\n</p>\n<p>\nThank you God, Hare Krishna\n</p>","quotee":"Duncan Trussell","platform":"The Duncan Trussell Family Hour","link":"http://www.duncantrussell.com/episodes/2016/11/22/emil-amos","length":"long"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2259100704"],"slicesMap":{}}
