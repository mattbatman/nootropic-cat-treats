Fucking fulfillment. And closure. Where the fuck those two...empty jars to hold this shitstorm.\n</p>\n<p>\nFucking nothing's ever fulfilled. Until the very end. And closure. No. No no. Nothing is ever over. The ontological fallacy of expecting a light at the end of the tunnel &mdash; well that's what the preacher sells. Same as the shrink. See preacher, he encourages your capacity for illusion, and he tells you it's a fucking virtue. Always a buck to be had doing that.\n</p>\n<p>\nHe's such a desparate sense of entitlement, isn't it? Surely this is all for me? Me? Me me me. I I. I'm so fucking important. I'm so fucking important, right?\n</p>\n\n","quotee":"Rust Cohle","platform":"True Detective, Season 1","link":"https://play.hbomax.com/page/urn:hbo:page:GVU2xlQZIxY7DwvwIAVgK:type:series"}},
