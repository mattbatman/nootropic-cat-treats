It's a tiny period in human history in which we grew up with freedom of speech, and we grew up with these protections of the court and from the constitution, but it's not some permanent state of affairs. It definitely won't last forever. I say to people who want to change any amendment &mdash; want to make an amendment to the amendements in the constitution &mdash; you almost don't have to, because major media companies have done it anyway. Major media companies: New York Times, CNN, etc., etc., &mdash; something your listeners might not know about called The Trusted News Initiative that's run by BBC, which is a whole collection of major media companies from all over the world who decide together on how to handle certain stories. And that's how you get 5,000 headlines that say Ivermectin is a horse paste.\n</p>","quotee":"Gavin de Becker","platform":"JRE #1800 - Gavin de Becker","link":"https://open.spotify.com/episode/3rAa8cJGt5cDSu71y9YC2A?si=0cb120a5d7394984"}},
